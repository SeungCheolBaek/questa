    This function is adapted from rsa_arry in mne-rsa 0.8dev.
    It Performs RSA on an array of data.

    Input
    ----------
    rdm_array : ndarray, shape (n_vertices, n_times, n_features)
        An array of precomputed neural RDMs.
    rdm_model : ndarray, shape (n_cond, n_cond) | (n_cond * (n_cond - 1) // 2,) | list of ndarray
        The model RDM(s). Both square (`scipy.spatial.distance.squareform`) and condensed forms are possible.
        A condensed form corresponds to the upper triangualr entries of a square form.
        For using multiple model RDMs, they should be provided as list.
    rsa_metric : str
        The RSA metric to use to compare neural and model RDMs.
        Valid options are:
        * 'regression-rsq-nnls' for r-squared by all models using linear regression based on NNLS.
        * 'nested-comp-uvar-nnls' for unique variance explained by each model using nested linear modeling based on NNLS.
        Defaults to 'regression-rsq-nnls'.
    weights : ndarry, shape (n_cond, n_cond) | list of ndarray
        A weight matrix or list of weight matrices to whiten distance estimates.
        If specified, a precomputed weight matrix should be provided.
        It can be computed by either assuming  the independence of noise between conditions,
        or by estimating the noise corvariance structure between conditions.
        If provided as list, the length should match the first dimension of a rdm_array.
        Defaults to None.

        Diedrichsen, J. et al. Comparing representational geometries using whitened unbiased-distance-matrix similarity.
        Neuron Behav Data Anal Theory 5, 1â€“31 (2020).
    n_jobs : int
        The number of processes (=number of CPU cores) to use. Specify -1 to use all available cores.
        Defaults to 1.
    verbose : bool
        If specified, a progress bar appears at the prompt.

    Returns
    -------
    rsa_vals : ndarray, shape ([n_vertices,] [n_times,] [n_rdm_models])
        The RSA value for each data point in input array.
        When multiple models have been supplied, the last dimension will contain RSA results for each model
        (also true for regression-rsq-nnls).
